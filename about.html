            <p><strong>Me</strong></p>
<p>Hi. I am Tim Sears. I live in Palo Alto, CA. My LinkedIn profile is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/timsears/">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>I started learning Haskell in earnest in 2009, after playing around with it for quite a while. Haskell and functional programming in general has since profoundly affected my thinking about everything from the practice of building systems to the connection between math and computer science. If you are a Haskeller, you might be thinking “of course it has” and if you aren’t, it might sound a little nuts. I urge you to dive a little deeper.</p>
<p>Anyway, I started this blog as a way to collect many of the hard things that should be easier for Haskell newbies and to try to map as many ideas as I can into Haskell. I have a background in machine learning and finance so some of those topics might sneak in as well.</p>
<p>Enjoy. Comments are welcome!</p>
<p><strong>Contact</strong></p>
